Hi, has the codebase already implemented the fixes for the bugs found by Zellic? I'm asking since docs state that:
>Previous audits: a report is currently being finalized by Zellic and will be made available within 48h of contest start.

We're getting a fresh codebase that everything we find (except known issues stated) are valid, right?

Interesting codebase, it doesn't seem ready at all because there are comments pointing out bugs such as:
 // 3.1. Rounding issue leads to total drain of vesting entries

This is directly in the codebase

[12/09/2024 22:19] itsmetechjay (pinned)
ℹ️ Any findings from the previous audit should be considered out of scope, except `sponsor confirmed` findings that were later mitigated (this should be indicated in the code), but where the fix is insufficient or introduced a new issue. 

If the SecondSwap team considered it a `wontfix` (i.e. `sponsor acknowledged` or `sponsor disputed`) in the preceding audit, and did not patch it, resubmitting it to this audit would a) have no value to the sponsor and b) most likely provide no value to wardens, since those issues are all known and could be submitted 100x.

I think that the sponsors should try and get those kind of issues listed as known issues.


[12/10/2024 05:39] c_moose
I guess we need to wait for sponsers to get us the list of known issues from the previous audit. Also there are some dev deps missing (`typescript` , `ts-node` etc) but that shouldn't be a big deal.


[12/10/2024 05:39] c_moose

[12/10/2024 15:48] z3nithpu1se
but shouldn't it be the team's work to inform us?


[12/10/2024 16:00] 0xgondarxyz
As far as I understood, the comments that are numbered about the issues are fixed in the codebase we have. I say this, in addition ot Izuman's comment above, that for instance there's this comment in unlistVesting function 

            //  3.4. The s2Admin is unable to unlist vesting
But in that function, admin is ABLE to unlist the vesting. So what I understand from there is that that was an issue raised by the Zellic team and the protocol has fixed it. 

So, we have a fresh codebase that just went through an audit.

 Everything is normal here. Although those comments make reading a bit confusing, I just choose to ignore them. There's the code after all


[12/10/2024 16:01] izuman
I know it is for the benefit of the Sponsor/Team they can add the Audit's known issues to the contest. For obvious reasons I don't think it is fair to update the contest for us Wardens. My advice is to wait until the audit is released.

This contest should have been postponed until the audit was finished.

What does locked tokens mean here in general, from what I can understand there is an issuer who locks tokens via vesting and later distributes it to others via whitelisting.
any real world example of such "lock" token?


[12/10/2024 23:38] 0xstalin
for example, the MORPH tokens that are allocated to the early investors/dev team.
They have vested tokens until a certain date, that means, they can't do anything with those tokens, they can not sell their tokens until those tokens are released (vesting period is over)

In the context of `listVesting` in `SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol` is `address _vestingPlan` an address of an already deployed  `SecondSwap_StepVesting.sol` contract?


[12/11/2024 06:07] nadir_khan_sec
Isn't it better to have more time to get to understand the protocol?


[12/11/2024 06:09] trtrth
no, time is not extended and we have risks that our findings could be invalid according to the known issues in audit report from Zellic

[12/11/2024 06:13] nadir_khan_sec

It just makes it easier for the sponsor to filter out. Imagine we are probably **100+** participating, with each of us maybe **3+** questions at least. 

If there are questions like; what does this function do?

The protocol might not take the time to answer 300 times the same thing. My way of thinking is just, make it easy for them to answer, very specific questions. If you do that, and make it proper, like `Question 1`, `Question 2`, etc.. they can just say:

> Q1 : Blabla
> Q2 : Blabla

Makes everything more organised and easier to see which one , they'll be eager to respond because you formulate the question the best way for you to perform at your best.

yo one question what happens if you find the same vulnerability class in more than one function.


[12/14/2024 07:58] owenzo
do you go around and make a report for each of those functions


[12/14/2024 07:58] owenzo
or do a genenaralized report for all functions that have the same vulnerability?


[12/14/2024 08:00] 0xaman.
if root cause is same and single fix can matigate it or same fix is required than you can submit it as a single report


[12/14/2024 08:00] mushow
I'd say the same, has to be the same rootcase / same fix for all of them

A number of wardens are asking the same questions that we feel it’s better to clarify directly in this channel:

1. Questions around referral fees - we noticed many questions in the private chats regarding referral calculations and payment/distribution mechanisms. Currently the team has not determined the best way to distribute referral payments and at this stage we will do off chain payment based on the collected referral data.

2. Questions around upgradeable proxies - we are using OZ upgradeable proxies, we did not write any code to extend it because we are only using it for the hardhat ignition modules.
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy

3. Questions around whitelists - anyone will be allowed to whitelist their own address, it serves simply to limit the number of users that have access to private listings.

Please continue to submit issues if you find any. Many questions we received were about why the referral fees are not transferred and it's because it's done off chain at the moment.

In Listing struct, I guess that pricePerToken indicates the price of the vested token in terms of Listing.currency, is this correct?


[12/14/2024 12:03] elser17
If you could please clarify


[12/14/2024 12:07] welith
yes, exactly... you set the total and balance to be the vesting token (i.e 1e18 or something differenct), and the pricePerUnit is the currency token representation

{Reactions}
✨ 

[12/14/2024 12:07] tusharr1411
yes '


[12/14/2024 12:09] elser17
And in which format is expressed this pricePerUnit variable?


[12/14/2024 12:09] elser17
And in which format is expressed this pricePerUnit variable?
1e18, basis points, 1:1 ratio...


[12/14/2024 12:13] welith
so imagine you have 100 vesting tokens that have 18 decimals. You set the total and balance to be e.g. 20e18, and you want 1 vestint token to be sold for e.g. 1 USDC, so the pricePerUnit will be 1e6


[12/14/2024 12:14] welith
From this the basePrice of the listing will be (20e18 * 1e6) / 1e18 = 20e6 or 20 USDC


[12/14/2024 12:16] .justuzair
are there any odd decimal tokens though? I dont know any, I thought they didn't exist


[12/14/2024 12:16] welith
meme tokens can be with all kind of token decimals, I guess they want to support them

but I think token issuer is the same as 3rd party who use the protocol to distribute their token

sooo idk if is it the same level of trusted as protocol owner/admin???


[12/14/2024 13:07] welith
It's stated in the contest page that the Token Issuer is set by the admin so yes trusted

Hello, I have another question about the referralFees. Are they supposed to be a percentage of the buy/sell fee or is it applied to the actual amount traded? For example, if amount bought is 100$ and  `buyFee` is 2.5% (2.5$) , and `referralFees` are set to 10%, then the referrer is supposed to get 10% out of the 2.5$ (meaning 0.25 cents) or are they supposed to get 10$ (10% of the full 100$ amount)?


[12/14/2024 17:54] welith

You can make a hacky thing like this
```
contract WrapperMarketPlace is SecondSwap_Marketplace {
  ListingType public listingType = ListingType.SINGLE;
  DiscountType public discountType = DiscountType.NO;
}
```

And just call the variable you need, for example:
`wrapperContract.listingType()`

Why is broken?
It works for me.


[12/15/2024 07:34] tusharr1411
correct me if I am wrong...  `token` is the token for which vesting is created and `usdt` is the one gonna be used as payment currency in marketplace. right ...? then `marketplace` should be initialize with the token which is going to be used as payment which in this case is  `usdt`  ?

[12/15/2024 14:29] memorydump55555
are you **sure** it works? i don't think you have actually ran it ser because you prank `admin` and do a token transfer when `admin` has not been allocated the amount, or approved the amount prior to the execution. this token transfer then fails. you also define 4 arguments for TestToken, yet it only accepts 3. it's definitely broken haha

and if it works for you then I think changes were made in the main contracts or your foundry is broken, and both of these cases worry me regarding PoC writing. be careful ser.


[12/15/2024 16:46] theschnilch
@Etcheverry Why does maxSellPercent exist? Why can't you just sell as much as you own?

The price has the decimals of the currency used to pay for it. So if the currency is e.g. USDT the price would have 6 decimals

[12/15/2024 22:22] 0xstalin
What's the error you get?


[12/15/2024 22:24] memorydump55555
it is a revert on `getVestingTokenAddress` require call (for decimals check), but after reading a message from bob he states that only the marketplace can interact with the `listVesting` function, and there is a marketplace modifier on `getVestingTokenAddresses` so that is probably the issue, as I am executing `listVesting` overall as alice


[12/15/2024 22:24] 0xstalin
have you configured the Marketplace as the Marketplace on the VestingManager?


[12/15/2024 22:25] memorydump55555
yep it's initialised, same with deployer

this specific issue is fixed: the `vestingPlan` deployment is returning the correct address in debug mode, but when you directly cast it to a address variable, it's a 0x000 addy. that's what broke everything for me xD apparently you can't do this in foundry (or skill issue on my part)...

[12/17/2024 06:46] trtrth
I think it is the ability to change allocation by transferring vestings or creating new ones. Not very sure about that


[12/17/2024 06:55] tusharr1411
I mean if it is allowed then they are definitely  missing a `reduceVesting()` function.


[12/17/2024 06:56] trtrth
I think it is unnecessary, since transferring vesting is enough


[12/17/2024 07:02] tusharr1411
yeah but transferring vesting to address(0)` is not allowed


[12/17/2024 07:03] tusharr1411
and reduceVesting() can transfer the reduced tokens back to tokenIssuer.


[12/17/2024 08:05] dot_cloud
reallocate should be allocating to other user
because thats what the contracts implement 😁


[12/17/2024 08:09] dot_cloud
transferVesting to tokenIssuer should have the same function


[12/17/2024 09:58] saurabh_0312

In Marketplace.listVesting, should I assume that the _price parameter is the price of 1 base unit of the vested token in terms of the currency token in the format of decimals that currency has?


[12/17/2024 12:24] 0xaman.
yes


[12/17/2024 12:24] elser17
If currency has 6 decimals, and 1 vested token equals 1 currency tokens, then _price should be 10**6, right?


[12/17/2024 12:24] elser17
OK


[12/17/2024 12:38] kyosi2963
The price will be scaled by the currency decimals, amount will be scaled by the vesting token decimals

if i am not mistaked, it's a mapping , so just 1 address can stand for a token


[12/19/2024 10:57] dot_cloud
it is tokenOwner[tokenaddress] = user address


[12/19/2024 11:42] chonkov
It is "tokenOwner[user] = token":
```
require(_tokenOwner[msg.sender] == tokenAddress, "SS_VestingDeployer: caller is not the token owner");
```
```
    function setTokenOwner(address token, address _owner) external onlyAdmin {
        require(_tokenOwner[_owner] == address(0), "SS_VestingDeployer: Existing token have owner");

In Foundry, you can get it from the logs like this:

        vestingDeployer.deployVesting({
            tokenAddress: address(vestingToken),
            startTime: block.timestamp,
            endTime: block.timestamp + 200 days,
            steps: 200,
            vestingId: "1"
        });

        Vm.Log[] memory entries = vm.getRecordedLogs();
        assertEq(entries.length, 3);

        // Check the event signature
        assertEq(
            entries[2].topics[0],
            keccak256("VestingDeployed(address,address,string)")
        );
        assertEq(entries[2].emitter, address(vestingDeployer));

        (address deployedVesting, ) = abi.decode(
            entries[2].data,
            (address, string)
        );

        SecondSwap_StepVesting vesting = SecondSwap_StepVesting(

malicious admin input? low/info max IMO 😁


[12/21/2024 11:19] owenzo
How long does judging take by the way?


[12/21/2024 11:21] xkeywordx
It is not malicious admin input, since the value is hardcoded in the constructor of MarketplaceSettings contract so this will always happen.

It means that the early unlisting functionality of the marketplace is broken because users can never use it


[12/21/2024 11:22] xkeywordx
The admin is not the one providing it as an input param during deployment, it is hardcoded. The unlisting fee will always be set to 10e18, but the fee is supoosed to be paid in USDT that has 6 decimals


[12/21/2024 11:50] rouhsamad
it should be maximum low/info, as admin can change it easily using setPenaltyFee 🤷‍♂

[12/21/2024 11:53] mushow
+ as said, the penalty is only during the first 2 minutes, to avoid people listing and unlisting directing (imo) its intended to have a penalty, maybe not that high, but still a high penalty taking into account USDT decimals then.


[12/21/2024 11:54] dot_cloud
it is to prevent spamming list unlist I think
thats why the duration is only the first 120 second for the penalty to kick in

[12/21/2024 13:10] y0ng0p3
The fact that it's easy to fix doesn't remove the impact sir

[12/21/2024 13:19] rouhsamad
i say there is an impact for sure, but mitigation very easy, admin can just send one more tranasction after deploying the contracts and fix it, so i dont know if its High/Medium issue, unless admin wants to temporary DDOS users for no reason and not receive any penalty fees


[12/21/2024 14:43] mrfalsegenius
What impact? What high? What mid? It uses safeTransferFrom which would fail because of "Insufficient 10 Trillion allowance/balance". 

Low at best

[12/21/2024 23:05] xkeywordx
I love how people downgrade all issues to Low/Info :))

There is an early unlisting feature that is completely broken, but no problem. What if minUnlistPeriod would've been 2 months instead of 2 minutes?


[12/21/2024 23:06] xkeywordx
That would've been an instant High because esentially users have their funds stuck for 2 months, right? Now, because they are only stuck for 2 minutes, there's no issue?

The bug is the same, it's just the minimum lock time that's different.


[12/22/2024 00:12] 0xstalin
nop, funds would not be locked for 2 months 🙂
Admin can simply update the value. If, big emphasis on if, there were no way to update the variable's value, that would be a totally different story, either way, let's not start a fight before the real war 🙂 let's leave the fun for PJQA 😉

{Reactions}
⚔️ (4) 👍 

[12/22/2024 12:03] .justuzair
Yup I understand the concern 
I still reported them as low or QA just because it is restricted to admin and again your point of locking period of 2 months is correct but admin can also change it before that time so it’s more like an info 
At least that’s what I feel 
Let’s leave it up to a judge 🫡😅


[12/22/2024 12:05] .justuzair
Lmao 
That’s exactly why I feel it to be a QA 

P.S. if it were up to me all would be high mediums, but that’s not how it works 😂😂

And also if it got downgraded I’d be mad to not get paid for a valid finding 😂


[12/22/2024 13:11] saurabh_0312

oh lol.. i assumed they did because mediums can get changed to high (if incorrectly reported) xD sorry


[12/26/2024 11:28] 0xsl1
it's only a temporary technical constraint due to a switch from having submissions on github to having them directly on c4 app

it take around 1 month for the final report i guess


[12/26/2024 17:28] .justuzair
can you explain a little, i dont get what it means, perhaps its something related to the SRs (backend role) ?


[12/26/2024 18:58] 0xsl1
I don't know the exact reasons but such functionality just does not seem to exist yet. I suppose they were trying to ship the update as fast as possible and then add things on the fly


[12/27/2024 07:58] 0xpetern
No, it's not a temporary technical constraint. It is an update to the judging rule.

The change was effected shortly before the c4 app became a thing. Not because of the c4 app.

It's more  on making judging more effective and discouraging auditors from submitting a poor report as low hoping to upgrade to med or high.

Any contest usually in C4 could take from 2 to 3 months to get the results and sometimes more. Judges are not slow, it's the process itself and it's conditions and circumstances. Meanwhile I suggest everyone can join another contest and focus on progress, the results will come out anyway.

I have a special affection for code4rena because it was the leading platform when I first started researching and it was the first platform where one of my vulnerabilities was accepted. However, the slow feedback loop is problematic for researchers, especially beginners... By the time I receive feedback on the vulnerabilities I submitted in this contest, I'll likely have forgotten exactly what the protocol was like, as I'll have already participated in several other contests. Anyway, that's the game, let's deal with it...

hoping mine get validated


[01/28/2025 12:28] saurabh_0312
do you have sr role


[01/28/2025 12:29] tusharr1411
It was in PJQA 2 days ago...
 Lambo took 5 days even after ending PJQA to announce the results ... and that too with fewer submissions compared to this...
So, I don't think the result will be out for at least 10 more days, considering the number of submissions

and we don't even know when PJQA started as someone with SR role mentioned on Jan 20, that the judging for this contest only started a week ago.

When he says "better to not hope much"

I think it means the likelihood of getting a high payout it really low across the board😂

These were my experiment contests. Lambo.win and this one. I did them almost side by side. Got the 15th place in lambo with 230 usdc payout. Since the report is still not out, I don't know which ones were valid and which ones were not. I don't care much about the payout on this one, need to get dem knowledge.

Congrats everyone.... @CloudEllie with this new rule of limiting submissions to 10 for each users with this kind of vulnerabilities it would be unfair to limited members.... just my thoughts 🫡

[02/12/2025 18:23] itsmetechjay
Awards are sent in two batches, which are dependent on when tax info is submitted.  The first batch has been sent.  If you recently submitted your tax info, you'll be included in the second batch that occurs ~30 days after awards are announced.


[02/12/2025 18:36] benterkiii
didn't receive anything, so it will be around the 7th of march!

The contest ID of `secondSwap` is 462 and it is not updated yet. It would be great if you update this `findings.csv` asap.
I think handling this is very easy as the result is came out already.

Unfortunately, decisions are final per our [fairness and validity doc](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/fairness-and-validity#if-you-disagree-with-a-judges-decision). I encourage you to continue participating and work towards earning the SR role in order to participate in Post-judging QA so that you can raise appeals in the future before judging decisions are finalized.


[02/20/2025 16:20] dot_cloud
💀  so my reward is lost
is it possible to at least fix the final report for correct dup? and my rank also? just add virtual $ I should have from that wrong dup to reflect on the ranking/profiles


[02/20/2025 16:26] itsmetechjay
I understand your disappointment, but as the audit went through an extensive post-judging QA period, and the decisions have been finalized, no updates to the report/leaderboard will be made at this time.


[02/20/2025 17:28] unpluggedtj
Sucks mate, let’s work for SR role 🫡


[02/20/2025 17:39] dot_cloud
grab those SR role so you can atleast check if your valid issue correctly categorized :4739_Skeletor:

Same happened to me. Grouped with a medium that doesn't match mine. Sad, but it is what it is. We will work for the SR role.💪 P.s Can you please send me the link to the H3? I can't find it in the report.

the H-03 is after the mitigation part of H-02

[02/23/2025 22:50] deeney3866
If your findings are heavily duplicated, it can result in less payout.


[02/24/2025 11:16] xkeywordx
if you don't have access to the SR role and the report is not public yet, how do you know what finding should your finding be grouped with? Is there a way to fetch the final findings that will be in the report?


[02/24/2025 11:23] dot_cloud
yes the final report already published

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 - Away I believe my submission is mistakenly grouped into another duplicate finding.
https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-12-secondswap/submissions/S-534 shouldn't it be grouped with H03?

[03/11/2025 01:15] itsmetechjay
If you mean when the awards are sent? They are sent in two batches.  Once within a week of announcement. And another about a week after the tax deadline, so it should be within the next week.
